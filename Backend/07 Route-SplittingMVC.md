# Route Splitting MVC

`Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.`


## What is the MVC?
MVC stands for `Model, View, Controller` is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. 

Each one of these components is built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
