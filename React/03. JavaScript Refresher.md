# JavaScript Refresher 

## 1. The "use strict" Directive
- The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".

- With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
```js
d = 12;     // ✅
console.log(d);
```
```js
"use strict"
d = 12;     // 💀❌ ReferenceError: d is not defined
console.log(d);
```

🎯Note: In react the strict mode is always on.
- In React, the strict mode is a development tool that provides warnings for potential issues in your code.
